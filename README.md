# Classic Frogger Arcade Game

## Summary

In this remake of the classic arcade game Frogger, the user is challenged to cross a treacherous three-lane highway riddled with speeding savage bugs. When the user reaches the other side, he is rewarded with a tasty dialog box. Should he butt heads with the enemy, he must restart his journey from the beginning.

## Goal

To win the game, the player must cross the highway and reach the water on the other side.
